# Relational-Database-Management-System
Applications that are more complicated are less maintainable and extensible. Maintainability  and complexity can be balanced with the use of flexible and dynamic principles. In order to  support dynamic objects, programming languages and software systems both use the role idea. Since there are no database systems that support dynamic data objects, complicated mappers 
must be used if data must be stored relationally. In this work, we present research on a relational 
database system that supports roles. We explore open research problems connected to our 
definition and provide a description of this notion based on current findings. We also cover the 
architecture as well as query language extensions because the role notion cannot be handled by 
current RDBMSs on an intrinsically basis.
Database management systems are really ubiquitous in the age of e-commerce. The 
development of relational database systems in theory and practice can be traced back to E. F. 
Codd's influential 1970 paper Relational Models of Data for Large Shared Data Banks [1]. 
With the advent of the Internet. Databases not only provide critical infrastructure for computer 
applications; they also process the transactions and exchanges that power much of the global 
economy. An important and growing segment of the software industry known as the database 
industry includes IBM Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Informix Corporation, Sybase 
Incorporated, Teradata Corporation, and Microsoft Corporation.
What Codd called the "relational model" was based on his two key points:
1. It provided the ability to describe data using only natural structures. H. No aspect of format, 
i. H. Additional structural overlays for machine rendering.
2. Between an application program on one side and a database system on the other. It thus 
provided a natural and consistent foundation for a high-level query language that allows for 
maximum independence
